# Squidux Code School
My notes while I'm immersed into javascript.
Here are the topics I'm involved in using javascript
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Functional programming {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJG-c65XkEU}
- React Development
- javascript Problem Solving

# REORGANIZE THIS TO
- Income Tradjectory and Roles
- Developer Roadmap
- Interview Prep
- What topics are basic
- What topics are overflow
- A Daily Routine for most effective knowledge aquisition and comprehension
- Proper Mental Attitude
- Learning Methods | repetition - hungry - structured 
Repetition & Falling into nuances like | trying to appear smarter than you are(with showcasing clone builds that aren't actually a result from them struggling to figure it out), pretending to struggle coding, posting html and css and say your coding. Avoid the truely technical stuff, avoid being patient, avoid asking questions, avoid clarifying your confusion and then just researching for an answer, avoid being focused, avoid actually writing code majority of the day. Avoid the hard parts of learning to code by just coding. Try to make complex things easier to understand before you understand them. Underestimate the amount of stuff you need to have experienced with coding. Excluding knowledge of self from the process of coding or learning to code something new.

- There is no genius
- Lose the ego
- Criticism is not evil
- Embrace failure
- Iterate Quickly
- Be a small fish
- Be influenced
- Be vulnerable
- Tools
- Involve collaborators early, but not too (at the 'sweet spot')

# Learning Approach
Project Based Learning
BEST APPROACH TO LEARNING FAST AND THROUGHLY
focus on => ++ Build Challenging Projects
- it keeps you focused
- doesn't realy on your memory
- makes you an active learner while using tuts just to give yo the basics to work with.

*** Combine more resouces in one place.(example from algoexpert.io for coding interviews)

** Advancing Software Chunks
*** Mastering Basics-- Not expected to know how to do deep problem solving translate psuedo code into code.
- Getting really comfortable with developer enviroment, coding tools, opening folders with terminal, github repo creations, adds, commits.
- errors around live server errors, or start server commands not launching,
- HTML and Beyond | syntax | Structure | Practice | Then Beyond - Template Literals, api url query, code src reference, classes&ID namings
- CSS and Beyond | syntax | Structure | Practice | Then Beyond - flexbox, sass, positioning, class & ID, components
- Javascript and Beyond | syntax | Structure | Practice | Then Beyond -Arraysfucntions, Objects, Functions, Conditionals, multi loops/conditionals, async, datastructures intro, complete projects with many javascript functions and files, jSX, console and return statements.

*** Core of Programmming
- Data manipulation problem solving
- Async for data mutation and transportaiont
- Time and Space complecity solutions
- Mult Solutions or Better code solutions
- Systems 

# Research
- video courses [supportive material]
- problem solving excersise [applied learning]
- group tutoring [collective overcoming of barriers]
- 101 tutoring [overcoming specific barriers]
- code review [validation of well applied learning]
- audio books [supportive material]
- mini project build approach [streching your learning]
- How Javascript works behind the scenes : https://blog.devgenius.io/how-javascript-works-behind-the-scenes-88c546173f32

# Project
Your going to build 1 really large software that requires you to apply all the basic and mid-level software concepts.
I think the best learning is when you actually need to build something that YOU find useful or that someone depends on a mission critical activity.
(bill gates building the software for the school payroll)
- 365 Year SQUARES PROGRESS
- BEST APPROACH IS TO STRUGGLE TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY USER DAILY.

## Project - Experience Hack
- Work on your own project on github and update it everyday using targeted speciality language.
- Invite others to improve it [team work]
- Invite others to test it and log issues [team work and code issue resolution]
- Document how you solved the problem with an article or video and explain the code implemented step by step [mastery of programming basics]
- Add features to shows to it. [create new features]

## Project - Social Media
- Use social media to share knowledge
