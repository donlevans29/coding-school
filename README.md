# Learning Approach
Project Based Learning
BEST APPROACH TO LEARNING FAST AND THROUGHLY
focus on => ++ Build Challenging Projects
- it keeps you focused
- doesn't realy on your memory
- makes you an active learner while using tuts just to give yo the basics to work with.

*** Combine more resouces in one place.(example from algoexpert.io for coding interviews)

** Advancing Software Chunks
*** Mastering Basics-- Not expected to know how to do deep problem solving translate psuedo code into code.
- Getting really comfortable with developer enviroment, coding tools, opening folders with terminal, github repo creations, adds, commits.
- errors around live server errors, or start server commands not launching,
- HTML and Beyond | syntax | Structure | Practice | Then Beyond - Template Literals, api url query, code src reference, classes&ID namings
- CSS and Beyond | syntax | Structure | Practice | Then Beyond - flexbox, sass, positioning, class & ID, components
- Javascript and Beyond | syntax | Structure | Practice | Then Beyond -Arraysfucntions, Objects, Functions, Conditionals, multi loops/conditionals, async, datastructures intro, complete projects with many javascript functions and files, jSX, console and return statements.

*** Core of Programmming
- Data manipulation problem solving
- Async for data mutation and transportaiont
- Time and Space complecity solutions
- Mult Solutions or Better code solutions
- Systems 

# Research
- video courses [supportive material]
- problem solving excersise [applied learning]
- group tutoring [collective overcoming of barriers]
- 101 tutoring [overcoming specific barriers]
- code review [validation of well applied learning]
- audio books [supportive material]
- mini project build approach [streching your learning]

# Project
Your going to build 1 really large software that requires you to apply all the basic and mid-level software concepts.
I think the best learning is when you actually need to build something that YOU find useful or that someone depends on a mission critical activity.
(bill gates building the software for the school payroll)

## Project - Experience Hack
- Work on your own project on github and update it everyday using targeted speciality language.
- Invite others to improve it [team work]
- Invite others to test it and log issues [team work and code issue resolution]
- Document how you solved the problem with an article or video and explain the code implemented step by step [mastery of programming basics]
- Add features to shows to it. [create new features]

## Project - Social Media
- Use social media to share knowledge
