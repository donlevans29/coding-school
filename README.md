# Research
- video courses [supportive material]

- group tutoring [collective overcoming of barriers]
- 101 tutoring [overcoming specific barriers]
- code review [validation of well applied learning]
- audio books [supportive material]
- mini project build approach [streching your learning]

# Project
Your going to build 1 really large software that requires you to apply all the basic and mid-level software concepts.
I think the best learning is when you actually need to build something that YOU find useful or that someone depends on a mission critical activity.
