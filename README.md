# Squidux Code School
documentation of the most efficient way to learn quickly and in-depth programming.

# Research
- video courses [supportive material]
- problem solving excersise [applied learning]
- group tutoring [collective overcoming of barriers]
- 101 tutoring [overcoming specific barriers]
- code review [validation of well applied learning]
- audio books [supportive material]
- mini project build approach [streching your learning]

# Project
Your going to build 1 really large software that requires you to apply all the basic and mid-level software concepts.
I think the best learning is when you actually need to build something that YOU find useful or that someone depends on a mission critical activity.
(bill gates building the software for the school payroll)

## Experience Hack
- Work on your own project on github and update it everyday using targeted speciality language.
- Invite others to improve it [team work]
- Invite others to test it and log issues [team work and code issue resolution]
- Document how you solved the problem with an article or video and explain the code implemented step by step [mastery of programming basics]
- Add features to shows to it. [create new features]
