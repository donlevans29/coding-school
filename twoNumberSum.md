TWO Number Sum - difficulty === easy
write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and
an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array
sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order.
if no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
an empty array.

Rules: You cannot add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.

1. To get the most out of this you NEED to understand the basics {link here}
*NOTE* Learn the basics form senior programmers whom have years of teaching other developers

2. Missing Component to many of the courses that I've learned from was the THINKING
part of it. 
 - how did you name the function
 - how to organize the code within a file
 - how to organize your files
 - how did we arrive at the solution we are implementing now.
 - history of evolution of the tools they are using and why they are being used in the first place
 - most important THE STRUGGLE OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE.
